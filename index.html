    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Hobbies (Interests)</h2>
    <p>
      Some of my main hobbies include fashion / clothes styling and drawing. I
      enjoy fashion design mainly because it allows me to openly express myself
      and my personality to others who don't necissarily know me. I also just
      enjoy being able to pick and design outfits in general. I find it as a fun
      passtime. I also enjoy drawing for simular reasons. I find it is a easy
      way to express my current emotions, while also not having to necissarily
      share all my feeling with someone else. I view drawing somewhat like how
      others may view journaling.

      The image on the left depicts a style/fashion that piques my intrest. I
      found the image to be fitting for a topic of clothing design. The image on
      the right is of a drawing portraying a person's emotions on a topic
      (books/homework). Considering that I use art to project my
      feelings/emotions, I felt this image was fitting.

    <h2>Favorite travel destinations</h2>
    <p>
      I haven't visited any countires other than Japan and Canada for more than
      just a layover. Hence, some of my favorite travel destionations are in
      Japan. I would say that Miyajima has been my favorite place to visit. I
      made many long standing memories on my visit back in the summer of 2018.
      Me and my family went to watch the New Years fireworks festival. That was
      one of the most memorable things about my visit. I also enjoyed the view
      and food stalls. People were very cheerful due to it being New Years Eve,
      which adds onto the great memories. This is mainly why Miyajima is my
      favorite travel destination.

    <p class="notes">
      I chose this photo due to it's simularity to how the fireworks in 2018
      looked. My Miyajima trip was a special moment for me. I felt it fit to
      include a photograph to help others picture this moment in time.

    <h2>Places I'd like to visit</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to visit london, England. I've always liked the architecture
      in London, and still want to admire it in person. I would also like to see
      the fashion styles in London / the UK in general. I also like London's
      atmoshere as a "busy city".I grew up in the counrtyside, 50 minutes out
      from the city, so I think it's actually pretty cool to see many people and
      be in anenvironment like that.

      I chose this photo as it showcases some places in London that I would want
      to visit if I travel there. This includes famous tourist acttracions, and
      restaurants.

    <h2>Favorite T.V. shows</h2>
    <p>
      A few of my favorite tv shows I've watched include Demon Slayer and Bungo
      Stray Dogs. I really enjoyed both shows due to the amount of character
      development, and attention to expressed emotions. All aspects of these
      shows were well thought out, and had a purpose. I enjoy any media or
      literature that can envoke strong feeling in the reader, and with well
      developed settings/character backstories.

      These photos were chosen to give an idea as to what my favorite T.V. shows
      look like. As they are something that interests me, I feel that they are
      fitting to the theme of this website/blog.

    <h2>People who have influenced me</h2>
    <p>
      I feel that many people influence me in some way. However, I feel like the
      person who has had the biggest positive impact on my life would be my
      mother. She has taught me how to take care of myself, and deal with life
      problems throughout my whole life. She has also taught me to treat
      everyone with respect, including myself. My mother has helped me learn
      about countless things, and how to use helpful life skills. She also
      supports me in my desicions, resulting in boosting my confindence. I feel
      that a lot of my personality and life views come from my mom.
    </p>
    <h2>Career plans</h2>
    <p>
      My long term goal for my career is to become a specialized nurse. As of
      now, I am leaning towards more of an E.R. involved position, so am not
      fully sure what I will specialize in. I am planning on persuing medical as
      the department has always sparked intrest to me, along with my family
      history in the medical field. In order to achieve this goal, I will have
      to research the pre-requisite courses I will have to complete in
      highschool, and go from there.

    <h2>Trip to Calgary</h2>
    <p>
      I went to Calgary for a martial arts event. Me, my mother, and my father
      all drove down to go to my event. This isn't my first trip to Calgary,
      neither is it my first martial arts event. However, I am still filled with
      the same anticipation and excitement. I feel that we should always live in
      the moment, and look forward to what comes next. I find many people look
      back into their past and old experiences, missing out on oppertunities to
      make more in the moment. Although I have "already experienced" a trip like
      this one before, I want to keep my mind open for new memories. I made many
      more scrapbook worthy memories on this trip because of this view, and feel
      that others should also try looking at the world in different ways!

    <p class="notes">
      The vivid colours and contrasting sky help bring out my feeling of
      anticipation and expectation. I also like this photo, as I was in downtown
      Calgary, looking at the same view. This photo helps others visualize the
      moment I tried to capture in writing.

    <h2>Typical Saturday</h2>
    <p>
      As usual, I went out to my mom and dad's house out by Pigeon lake on the
      weekend. Located around 50 or so minutes away from Edmonton, their house
      is very isolated and quiet. Perhaps for someone who is always bustling
      with restlessness or just a social butterfly, this would seem kind of
      lonesome. For me, I take this time to recuperate, and "charge myself up"
      for another eventful week ahead. Another one of my pass times is
      photography. When out in, quite frankly, the middle of nowhere, the
      scenery is gentle and reserved. This makes for easy shots of sun rise/ sun
      sets. If I'm lucky, I can also capture the rare photo of an wild animal
      like a moose or buck. I find that being out in the countryside also helps
      me de-stress and unwind any strong emotions I may have kept bottled up.

      Pigeon lake is captured in this photo. I felt that this specific photo
      helps to bring out my emphasism on the calm, worry-free environment I am
      surrounded by.
